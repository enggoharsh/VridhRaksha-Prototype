# VridhRaksha â€“ Fall Detection Prototype

**VridhRaksha** is an AI-powered fall detection system designed to protect elderly individuals using non-intrusive, radar-based sensing. This prototype demonstrates fall classification using deep learning models applied on spectrogram images generated from micro-Doppler radar signals.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook contains:
- Radar signal preprocessing using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
- Spectrogram image generation
- Deep learning model (MobileNetV2) for fall classification
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
